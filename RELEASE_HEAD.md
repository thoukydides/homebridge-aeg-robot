# homebridge-aeg-robot

AEG RX 9 / Electrolux Pure i9 robot vacuum plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

As of iOS 18.4, the Apple Home app includes native support for robot vacuum cleaners via Matter. This functionality is not available through legacy HAP (HomeKit Accessory Protocol) services or characteristics; only via Matter.

Homebridge does not support Matter. To enable full HomeKit integration, a new [Matterbridge](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge) plugin has been developed.

Please migrate to [matterbridge-aeg-robot](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-aeg-robot).

This plugin will soon be archived and no longer maintained.
