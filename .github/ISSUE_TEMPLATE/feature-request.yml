        **Important Notes:**
        - Feature requests must align with HomeKit's intended functionality and Electrolux Group API capabilities.
        - Features outside the scope of HomeKit or Electrolux Group API are unlikely to be implemented.
        - Detailed, actionable suggestions, are more likely to be considered.
